In order to write readable, efficient code it is important to create variables that match the nature of the data.\n","\n","For simple data types, Python figures out what data type is best when you create a new variable. An important thing to keep in mind when naming variables is that it's up to you to name them well. There are a number of different data types in Python, but there's no distinction as to how you must name them. This means that it is up to you to give good, descriptive names to your variables.\n","\n","### Why is that important?\n","\n","The point of descriptive variable names is to improve readability and understanding of code for both yourself and others. While you may believe that you will never re-use a piece of code, or that if you do you will remember what you were doing, the truth is that you won't. **Good naming practices make all the difference.**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VT6z8eUlUrfq"},"source":["## Creating variables\n","\n","Variable = Vary + Able = Something which can vary in its value.\n","\n","- Think of a variable name as a box.\n","- Think of a variable value as an item in the box.\n","- Think of defining variable as putting an item in the box.\n","- Calling the variable means opening the box, which will show the item inside it.\n","\n","<img src = \"https://lab.arts.ac.uk/uploads/images/gallery/2023-08/scaled-1680-/RgkssQLT88g7Q0Lk-image-1692714764115.png\" width=400/>\n","\n","\n","\n","One creates a variable by assigning a value to it:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"PDhb_-32Urfr"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define a variable called x with some value\n","\n","\n","# = is an assignment operator.\n","# The value at left side of = goes to the variable at right side."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"K2mTfnsVa0nL"},"source":["<img src = \"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*nbnwA9n-RebunC2-hEHXuw.png\" width = 400>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"o4lqvRqOUrfx"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Print the value of x using print() method\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"D8pcjSrbUrgI"},"source":["As its name suggest, a variable can have its associated value **changed**.\n","\n","Think of it like replacing the item in the box."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"LaJF8Gg6UrgJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Redefine x with some other value and print in the same code cell\n","\n","print(x)\n","\n","x = 20   # same variable getting redefined.\n","\n","print(x)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"feLi3gNja0nV"},"source":["**NOTE:**: The sequence of output is in the same order as of the sequence of the execution of the code."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"-eCO7dROa0nY"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Run this 2nd.\n","\n","print(y + 10)\n","\n","# You will get error.
